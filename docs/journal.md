## 2026-06-19 — Phase 6.1: gnark PLONK outer backend in `zkwrap-gnark` (PR1)

- **Work done:** locked the PLONK wire format
  (`docs/schemas/plonk-outer-proof-artifacts.md`, committed `cb555b1`) and added
  `zkwrap-gnark --backend plonk` (serialization, setup/prove/verify, backend
  auto-dispatch from `outer_vk.json`). Tiny-circuit round-trip tests run in
  `-short`; full `setup → prove → verify` end-to-end passed against the real RISC
  Zero fixture (217s). Split `internal/outer` into `outer` (shared) + `outer/groth16`
  + `outer/plonk`. (PR1 code under review on `feature/plonk-integration`.)
- **`lin_digest`:** the linearized-poly commitment gnark computes internally but
  exposes nowhere, so we reimplement the verifier (SHA-256 + BLS12-381) to derive it.
  Aiken still recomputes it on-chain via MSM, but Plutus has no point→uncompressed
  builtin (gnark hashes the uncompressed form), so the proof ships it and binds with
  `compress(supplied) == compress(computed)`.
- **Findings:** PLONK compiles per inner system with exact `num_inputs` (no
  `MAX_INPUTS` padding — diverges from ADR-0002, whose padding only avoids a Groth16
  ceremony); the outer VK depends only on `num_inputs`, so same-`n_real` systems
  (RISC Zero, SP1 v6) share it. PLONK ≈ Groth16 end-to-end (217s vs 230s,
  setup-dominated).
- **Follow-ups:** ADR for the transcript-hash/SRS choices + the `num_inputs`
  divergence; PR2 (Rust `PlonkBackend` + `plonk.ak` codegen + fixtures);
  `zkwrap-prover` returns the concrete Groth16 `OuterProof` — generalize for PLONK.

## 2026-06-18 — Phase 5: SP1 plugin (`zkwrap-sp1`), targeting current SP1 (v6.1.0)

- **Context:** second inner-system plugin, mirroring the RISC Zero one. Started against a stale SP1 (v3.0.0 / 2 public inputs) from the old experiment, then reworked to **current SP1 (sp1-sdk 6.2.4, circuit v6.1.0)** — it's the version anyone integrating today will use, and its public-input shape is what we must commit to on-chain.
- **Work done:**
  - New crate **`zkwrap-sp1`** (`SYSTEM_ID = "sp1-v6"`): `canonicalize` + `Sp1Codegen` + `build_validator`/`Sp1ValidatorRequest`, same shape as `zkwrap-risc0`.
  - **`canonicalize(&SP1Proof, public_values)`** — one call on the native `sp1-verifier` types. It decodes the fixed Groth16 VK and the proof on the fly through `sp1-verifier`'s public `ark` API (`GROTH16_VK_BYTES`, `load_ark_groth16_verifying_key_from_bytes`, `load_ark_proof_from_bytes`) — **no committed VK blob, no copied converter, no `sp1-sdk` dependency** in the crate. It ark-verifies the inner proof against the 5 inputs (with `committed_values_digest` recomputed from `public_values`) before emitting the canonical bundle, and **rejects `exit_code != 0`** (only successful executions wrap).
  - SP1 v6's **5 BN254 public inputs** `[vkey_hash, committed_values_digest, exit_code, vk_root, proof_nonce]` (v3 had 2). On-chain proof bytes are 356 B = 4-B vkey prefix ‖ exit_code ‖ vk_root ‖ proof_nonce ‖ 256-B gnark proof. Codegen bakes `sp1_program_vkey_hash`/`exit_code`/`vk_root`; `committed_values_digest = SHA256(public_values) mod 2^253` is derived on-chain; `proof_nonce` rides in the redeemer.
  - **`examples/sp1-aiken-groth16`** (live host: prove → canonicalize → gnark wrap → `build_validator` → `aiken check`) and **`experiments/sp1-v6-hello-world`** (the artifact-dump experiment; `sp1-sdk` lives only here and in the example, with `native-gnark` + vendored OpenSSL). Format pinned in `docs/research/sp1-artifact-format-v6.md`.
  - Fixtures: `fixtures/canonical-inner/sp1-hello-world/` trimmed to the pure bundle, outer proofs moved to `fixtures/outer-proofs/<inner>-groth16-outer-proof.json`.
- **Findings:**
  - **SP1 v6's 5 inputs match RISC Zero's 5** — so the universal outer circuit (`MAX_INPUTS = 8`) and the *committed* trusted setup cover SP1 with **no new ceremony**; the public-input vector is `[i0..i4, 0, 0, 0]`.
  - **ark version split is load-bearing.** `sp1-verifier 6.2.4` pins **ark 0.5**, so `zkwrap-sp1` stays on 0.5 while `zkwrap-core`/`zkwrap-risc0` moved to **0.6** (Dependabot #19). The two coexist per-crate (`deny.toml` `multiple-versions = "warn"`); it blocks sharing the canonical-VK/Fr encoding helpers into core for now. Layout regressions are still caught at `cargo test` time by the byte-exact `canonicalize_matches_committed_bundle` oracle test.
  - **SP1 local CPU Groth16 proving is too heavy for free hosted CI** (~16 GB+ RAM, many minutes → OOM/timeout). Dropped the live SP1 example from nightly; SP1's wrap + validator path stays covered by the acceptance test (fixture → `build_validator` → `aiken check`) and the oracle test, and RISC Zero's live nightly run exercises the identical outer circuit.
- **Open questions / follow-ups:** extract the shared outer-test generator into `zkwrap-core` (deferred — blocked on unifying the ark version); add a Dependabot ignore so it stops proposing ark 0.6 for `zkwrap-sp1`.
- **Links:** PR #21; `zkwrap-rs/zkwrap-sp1/`, `docs/research/sp1-artifact-format-v6.md`.

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 4 step 3: RISC Zero end-to-end (off-chain)

- **Work done:** wired the full live pipeline `Receipt → canonicalize → GnarkCliProver::prove → build_validator → aiken check`, with no hand-staged fixtures between steps.
  - New crate **`zkwrap-prover`** — the off-chain driver: a `Prover` trait + `GnarkCliProver` (ADR-0008's `CliProver` slice; spawns the one-shot `zkwrap-gnark prove` over the ADR-0003 file boundary). ADR-0008 bumped to *partially implemented*.
  - **`zkwrap_risc0::build_validator`** — one-call factory: outer-backend dispatch (`match` on the proof's `backend` id), the standard positive/tamper test suite, and `compose`. Hosts no longer hand-assemble `ComposeRequest` or Aiken test snippets; the acceptance test now drives it.
  - **`examples/risc0-aiken-groth16`** — standalone runnable host crate (vendored `multiply` guest); its README is the tutorial. Not a workspace member, so the slow guest build stays out of the everyday `cargo` loop.
  - Errors migrated to `thiserror` across the workspace; generated `aiken.toml` compiler bumped to 1.1.22.
- **Findings:**
  - **On-chain is feasible.** `aiken check` reports `verify_risc0_valid_proof` at cpu ≈ 3.9 B / mem ≈ 92 K — ~39% of the ~10 B cpu preview per-tx budget, <1% mem. This was the flagged top risk for Phase 4.
  - **gnark PK load is pathological from `/mnt`.** gnark deserializes the 1 GB proving key with many tiny reads — ~30 min over the WSL 9p Windows mount vs ~33 s on native ext4. Keep `ZKWRAP_SETUP_DIR` on native fs; the CLI reloads the PK every call (the `ServiceProver` that would amortize it is still deferred).
- **Links:** PR #18.

## 2026-06-11 — Phase 4: RISC Zero `canonicalize` + shared `fixtures/` reorg

**`canonicalize` — the plugin's serializer half.** Added `zkwrap_risc0::canonicalize`:
native RISC Zero `Receipt` → canonical inner-proof bundle, I/O-free, with a
`Canonicalized::write_to` that persists `vk.bin`/`proof.bin`/`public_inputs.bin`/`meta.json`.
It `verify`s the receipt against `image_id` first, takes the 256-byte seal as the proof,
decodes the fixed risc0 Groth16 VK through ark into the canonical layout, and rebuilds the
5 BN254 public inputs (split-digest of `control_root` and `claim_digest`, plus
`Fr(reverse(bn254_control_id))`). The per-guest `codegen` section rides alongside as a field
of `Canonicalized`, *not* inside `CanonicalInnerProof` — the latter stays the pure,
system-agnostic crypto contract (ADR-0007). An oracle test canonicalizes the committed
hello-world receipt and asserts byte-equality with both the committed bundle and the Go
`gen-testdata` output. The risc0 stack is an unconditional dep (Linux-only C++ kernels;
tests run under WSL).

**Shared `fixtures/` reorg.** `zkwrap-gnark/testdata/` had quietly become a cross-language
fixture store — read by both Go and Rust, and reached into from `experiments/` by the new
`canonicalize` test. Lifted it to a repo-root `fixtures/` tree organized by domain
(`risc0-hello-world/`, `canonical-inner/`, `groth16-setup/`, `groth16-outer-proof.json`) and
copied the risc0 raw artifacts in so the shipped crates stop reaching into `experiments/`.
Repointed every Go/Rust reader and the `gen-testdata` defaults, moved the gitignore rule, and
fixed a stale `dump_vectors_test` output path. The Poseidon2 KAT vectors stay embedded in
`zkwrap-core` (compile-time unit-test oracle, not a runtime fixture). Verified: full Rust
workspace + Go green (incl. the 239 s setup→prove→verify integration); `gen-testdata`
reproduces the bundle byte-for-byte.

## 2026-06-10 — Prover invocation model (preliminary ADR-0008)

Wrote a **preliminary** ADR-0008 to capture a constraint before it bites: loading the ~1 GB
proving key from disk dominates wall-clock (~40 s, vs ~7 s for proving itself), so a
long-lived prover *service* is the likely target. The sketch keeps a transport-neutral
serialization (the canonical inner bundle) behind a `Prover` abstraction — `CliProver` now,
`ServiceProver` (RPC/HTTP) later — so the disk-bound path can be swapped without touching
callers. Flagged explicitly as provisional (the `zkwrap-prover` driver-crate placement and the
service protocol are open). This is what shaped `canonicalize` into an I/O-free core plus a thin
`write_to`, so a host can wrap in-memory without staging to disk.

## 2026-06-02 — Rust `InnerVKHash` cross-check

Added a pure-Rust Poseidon2-MD/BLS12-381 + `InnerVKHash` reimplementation in
`zkwrap-core` (`poseidon2.rs`, `vk_hash.rs`), matching gnark-crypto limb-for-limb;
round-trips to `0c42ca6b…bbe8e6ca` on the real RISC Zero fixture. Vectors are dumped from
the gnark reference (`go test ./internal/circuit -run TestDumpVKHashVectors -dump-vectors`)
into `testdata/inner_vk_hash_vectors.json`.

Decided it is **cross-check only, not the codegen path**: Aiken codegen reads `inner_vk_hash`
straight from the gnark prover output (`outer_proof.json`), so gnark stays the single source
of truth and we avoid a second production hash impl that must agree forever. The Rust twin
exists to catch a *silent `gnark-crypto` Poseidon2 change*. This resolves ADR-0005's deferred
"Rust vs Go helper" question (ADR-0005 updated).

## 2026-06-01 — Verifier CPU Optimization Attempts

Tried two CPU optimizations on the spike verifier; kept one, dropped one.

**Kept — zero-input IC skip.** `compute_vk_x` now elides the `uncompress + scalar_mul + add` for any public-input slot whose scalar is 0 (sound: `0·P = O`). RISC Zero's `n_real = 5` always leaves 3 zero-padded slots under `MAX_INPUTS = 8`. Saved **390 M CPU** (4.28 B → 3.89 B), i.e. ~130 M per IC term. Note: data-dependent — a proof filling all 8 slots gets no benefit, so worst-case budget is still ~4.28 B.

**Dropped — random-batched pairing.** Folding the Pedersen PoK and Groth16 checks into one `final_verify` via a Fiat-Shamir scalar saved only **170 M** (3.89 B → 3.72 B): one `final_verify` (~430 M) is mostly offset by the two added `g1_scalar_mul`s (~260 M) needed to scale `commitment` and `pok` by `r`. Hashing less in the challenge can't help — the hash is ~5 M (noise), and soundness requires `r` to bind all prover-chosen values (`A, B, C, commitment, pok`), so the transcript can't shrink. Not worth the harder soundness story (RO + Schwartz–Zippel) for ~4.5%. Plain `verify` stays the lead — it mirrors gnark `verify.go` 1:1.

**Cost-model finding:** `bls12_381_g1_scalar_mul` has ~constant CPU (~130 M) regardless of scalar bit-length — truncating `r` to 128 bits changed nothing. The pairing floor is 6 miller loops; `e(α,β)` can't be precomputed (no GT constant/literal in Plutus V3).

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 3 Step 1: Aiken Verifier Spike

Work done:
- Hand-wrote a single-file Aiken verifier (`experiments/aiken-verifier-spike/validators/spike.ak`) that verifies one real Phase 2 outer proof end-to-end against `MAX_INPUTS = 8` with the RISC Zero canonical inner fixture.
- Pinned the Bowe–Gabizon Pedersen-commitment-on-Cardano algorithm in **ADR-0006**: PoK pairing equation, ExpandMsgXmd-SHA256 hash-to-Fr for the implicit folded public input, and the binding strategy that ties the redeemer-supplied 96-byte uncompressed commitment to its 48-byte compressed form (via `2·y > q` y-sign reconstruction).
- Both layers from ADR-0004 in one file:
  - **Layer 1** (generic): Groth16 + Bowe–Gabizon — IC accumulation over `[InnerVKHash, inputs…, commit_fr]` plus the bare-commitment fold-in, Pedersen PoK pairing, Groth16 pairing.
  - **Layer 2** (RISC Zero): reconstructs `claim_digest` from `journal_bytes` via the `tagged_struct` chain (3 SHA-256s), assembles the 5 RISC Zero public inputs from version constants + split-digest, then delegates to Layer 1.
- Nine inline tests cover hash-to-Fr, compressed-uncompressed binding, full verifier (positive + two tampered), claim-digest reconstruction, input vector, end-to-end via `verify_risc0` (positive + tampered journal).

Findings:
- **End-to-end verification fits comfortably in the Plutus V3 budget.** Layer 1 `verify` costs **4.28 B CPU** / **52.53 K mem** — ~43% of the 10 B mainnet CPU budget, ~0.4% of the 14 M mem budget.
- **Layer 2 is essentially free on top of Layer 1.** Full `verify_risc0` is **4.28 B CPU** / **62.89 K mem** — same CPU within rounding because the Groth16 pairing dominates; +10 K mem and +8.6 M CPU for the journal-side work in isolation (`claim_digest_chain_matches` + `risc0_inputs_match_fixture`).

Open questions:
- **Codegen.** The spike is single-fixture; Phase 3 step 2 lifts it into a Rust string template inside `zkwrap-risc0` with parameterised constants (outer VK points, IC, commitment keys, MAX_INPUTS, `InnerVKHash`, RISC Zero version constants, plus per-guest pre/post state digests for Layer 2).

## 2026-05-29 - Phase 2 Complete: `zkwrap-gnark` Binary

Work done:
- Lifted the recursive Groth16/BLS12-381 wrapper from the experiment into the `zkwrap-gnark` binary. Three subcommands per ADR-0004: `unsafe-setup`, `prove`, `verify`.
- End-to-end smoke test runs `unsafe-setup → prove → verify` against the RISC Zero Phase 1 fixture inside `go test`.
- Extended `docs/schemas/outer-proof-artifacts.md` with the commitment fields the recursive verifier requires (`commitment_keys`, `public_and_commitment_committed`, `proof.commitments`, `proof.commitment_pok`).

Phase 2 exit criteria met: end-to-end off-chain prove + verify works against a real Phase 1 inner proof.

- Outer artifact schema: `docs/schemas/outer-proof-artifacts.md`
- Binary entrypoint: `zkwrap-gnark/cmd/zkwrap-gnark/main.go`

## 2026-05-26 - Phase 2 Step 1: MAX_INPUTS Benchmark and Poseidon Choice

Work done:
- Extended the RISC Zero recursive experiment into a parameterised production-shaped wrapper circuit (Poseidon2-MD `InnerVKHash`, outer public inputs `[InnerVKHash, input_0..input_{MAX-1}]`).
- Benchmarked three `MAX_INPUTS` candidates against the RISC Zero Phase 1 fixture, end-to-end prove + verify.
- Locked `MAX_INPUTS = 8` into ADR-0002 with the benchmark table and marginal-cost analysis.
- Resolved the off-circuit Poseidon choice: Poseidon2 over BLS12-381 Fr with gnark-crypto default parameters, Merkle-Damgård chaining. Captured in new ADR-0005.

Findings:
- Inner Groth16 verification in `std/recursion/groth16` requires `WithCompleteArithmetic` once IC slots are padded with `(0,0)` and zero scalars — without it the prover hits "no modular inverse" during witness solving.
- After refactor the wrapper circuit is now universal in `n_real`: it has no compile-time awareness of how many slots are real for a given inner system. The Aiken validator carries the excess-zero check, per ADR-0002.
- Inner-witness scalars are derived in-circuit directly from the outer public inputs (single source of truth), with bit decomposition that admits a small `[BN254_Fr_mod, 2^254)` gap caught by the Aiken layer.

## 2026-05-21 - risc0-ethereum Architecture Review

Reviewed `../risc0-ethereum/` for spec cross-validation and on-chain design patterns.
Full notes: `docs/research/risc0-ethereum-architecture.md`.

- All serialization specs confirmed (no corrections needed).
- Three-layer generation model (snarkJS VK + generated constants + static glue) mirrors ADR-0004.
- Complete V5.0 test vector in `contracts/test/TestReceiptV5_0.sol` — useful integration fixture.
- `RiscZeroSetVerifier` documents a Merkle batching pattern worth noting for Phase 3+ scaling.

## 2026-05-21 - Phase 1 Complete: Schema Lock and Architecture

Phase 1 (schema lock) is done. Phase 2 begins.

Work done:
- Locked canonical inner proof format (`docs/schemas/canonical-inner-proof.md`) — byte-level contract between Rust plugin and Go prover binary.
- Documented RISC Zero artifact format including journal authentication hash chain (`docs/research/risc0-artifact-format.md`).
- Written four ADRs and domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`).

Key decisions:
- **ADR-0001:** Expose inner public inputs directly as `[VKHash, input_0..input_{MAX-1}]` — no `InputCommitment`. Soundness from the BLS12-381 proof; no on-chain hash recomputation needed.
- **ADR-0002:** Single wrapper circuit with fixed `MAX_INPUTS`. Unused IC slots padded to identity; Aiken validator checks excess slots are zero.
- **ADR-0003:** File-based boundary between Rust plugin and Go prover (CGO rejected).
- **ADR-0004:** Rust plugin crates own Aiken codegen. Generated validator has two layers: generic BLS12-381 verification + system-specific journal auth and zero-checks. Go binary is a pure prover only.

Finding: RISC Zero journal auth is feasible on Cardano — ~4 SHA-256 calls via `tagged_struct`, all using the Cardano native SHA-256 builtin. Tag digests baked as constants at codegen time. SP1 equivalent is 1 SHA-256 call.

Note: the 2026-05-14 finding ("universal circuit infeasible") was wrong — `MAX_INPUTS` with IC padding solves it.

## 2026-05-19 - PLONK Outer Wrapping for SP1 and RISC Zero

Work done:
- Added `experiments/sp1-gnark-verifier/recursive_plonk/` — wraps the SP1 BN254 Groth16 inner
  proof in a BLS12-381 PLONK outer proof using `gnark/backend/plonk` + `frontend/cs/scs`.
- Added `experiments/risc0-gnark-verifier/recursive_plonk/` — same approach for the RISC Zero

Findings:
- PLONK wrapping takes ~1 minute to create a proof, roughly
  10× slower than the Groth16 outer (~5s).
- Key advantage over Groth16 outer: PLONK uses a universal KZG SRS that is circuit-independent.
  Groth16 requires a fresh trusted setup per circuit (i.e. per inner proof system / innerNPublic
  count); PLONK does not — the same SRS covers any circuit up to the supported size bound.
- Circuit definition is identical in both cases: the outer circuit verifies an emulated BN254
  Groth16 proof regardless of whether the outer system is Groth16 or PLONK.

## 2026-05-18 - SP1 Groth16 Artifact Extraction and gnark Verification

Work done:
- Implemented `experiments/sp1-hello-world/` — proves `multiply(17, 23)` with SP1 v3.4.0
  (`native-gnark` feature, no Docker) and writes Groth16/BN254 fixtures to `fixtures/`.
- Implemented `experiments/sp1-gnark-verifier/` — standalone BN254 verifier and BLS12-381
  recursive wrapper, mirroring the RISC Zero verifier structure.
- Documented artifact format in `docs/research/sp1-artifact-format.md`.

Findings:
- SP1 has **2 public inputs** (`vkey_hash`, `committed_values_digest`) vs RISC Zero's 5.
- A universal outer circuit covering both is feasible: compile with `innerNPublic = 5`, pad SP1's IC with identity points, enforce extra inputs as zero off-circuit. See `docs/research/sp1-artifact-format.md §9`.

## 2026-05-14 - Recursive gnark Verification of RISC Zero Proof

Work done:
- Implemented `experiments/risc0-gnark-verifier/` — Go module with a RISC Zero BN254 Groth16 proof verified inside a BLS12-381 Groth16 outer circuit using `gnark/std/recursion/groth16`. ~5s prove time.

Findings:
- A universal wrapper circuit shared across different inner proof systems (RISC Zero, SP1, etc.) is likely infeasible. The outer circuit's R1CS encodes the inner VK structure — specifically number of public inputs — at compile time. If RISC Zero and SP1 have different numbers of public inputs, they require different outer circuits and therefore different trusted setups. There is no structural workaround: each inner proof system needs its own wrapper circuit and its own setup ceremony.

## 2026-05-12 - RISC Zero Groth16 Fixture Extraction

Work done:
- Implemented `experiments/risc0-hello-world/src/bin/dump_groth16.rs` — proves a sample computation with `ProverOpts::groth16()` and extracts all data needed for downstream BN254 Groth16 verification:
  - `seal.bin` — raw Groth16 proof (A, B, C elliptic curve points)
  - `vk.json` — verifying key in snarkjs-compatible JSON format
  - `public_inputs.json` — 5 BN254 Fr field elements passed to the verifier
  - `claim_digest.bin` — hash of the execution result (proof-specific)
  - `control_root.bin` / `bn254_control_id.bin` — RISC Zero circuit version identifiers (fixed per risc0 release)
  - `journal.bin` / `image_id.bin` — guest output and program identity
- Added a self-verification cross-check: reads fixtures back and runs `risc0_groth16::Verifier` to confirm encoding is correct.
- Documented fixture roles and public input derivation in `fixtures/README.md`.

Findings:
- VK is system-wide (not per guest program) — fixed for a given risc0 release.
- `control_root` and `bn254_control_id` are enforced as public inputs by the Groth16 circuit itself, binding the proof to a specific RISC Zero version.

Insight — wrapper plugin as a library:
- The risc0 plugin could be a Rust library crate that host programs import directly, rather than a standalone CLI tool. The library would extract proof artifacts in the format expected by the gnark BLS wrapper and write them to disk (or return them in-memory). This would significantly reduce developer friction — no separate tool invocation, no format mismatch, just a function call inside the existing host program.
- Exact artifact formats (binary vs JSON, file layout) are not decided yet and should be pinned once the gnark side is understood.

## 2026-05-04 - LLM Development Workflow Setup

Context:
- The project is still in the planning and feasibility stage, before implementation has started.
- We wanted the repository to be easier for LLM agents and humans to navigate consistently across sessions.

Work done:
- Added `AGENTS.md` as the main project instruction file for LLM-driven development.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` as a thin redirect to `AGENTS.md`, keeping one source of truth for agent instructions.
- Organized `docs/` around separate purposes: `research/`, `decisions/`, `schemas/`, `tasks/`, and this journal.
- Updated `docs/implementation-plan.md` so the compatibility audit is Phase 1 and links point to the current `docs/research/` paths.

Findings:
- `docs/journal.md` is useful as chronological working memory: progress notes, experiments, observations, and open questions.
- `docs/decisions/` should be reserved for durable architecture decisions that future work should treat as settled.
- `docs/schemas/` should hold precise data contracts for proof artifacts, wrapper witnesses, plugin outputs, and redeemers.
- `docs/tasks/` should hold bounded implementation briefs with deliverables and acceptance criteria.

Open questions:
- Exact external dependency workspace layout is still undecided, though a sibling directory such as `../groth16-wrapper-deps/` looks preferable to vendoring RISC Zero and SP1 into this repository.
- A dependency lock/notes format should be added once real RISC Zero and SP1 artifact audits begin.
